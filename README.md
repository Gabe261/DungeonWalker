# DungeonWalker

Dungeon Walker is a 2D top-down dungeon crawler rouge lite. The player is trapped in a dungeon and is forced to find their way out dodging deadly traps such as protruding floor spikes and flame throwers. The player is in a race against time to collect as many points as possible in the shortest amount of time.
Dungeon Walker contains a set of randomly generating levels, some are like a maze and others contain a multitude of traps in a randomly generated pattern. Each new run of the game is unlike any previous runs to test the players adaptability. The playerâ€™s score is based off of three criteria: the amount of time it takes to complete the levels, the amount of points collected throughout the levels and a deduction for the amount of player deaths. The player can save their score to a file and check all the high scores that have been saved. 
Dungeon walker contains multiple sound effects, background songs and animations which trigger off different events.
